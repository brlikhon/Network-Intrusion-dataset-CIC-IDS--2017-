# Network Intrusion Detection with CIC-IDS-2017

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset to build and evaluate machine learning models for network intrusion detection. The entire pipeline, from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to model training, interpretation, and forensic investigation, is documented.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The primary goals of this analysis are to:
* Analyze the CIC-IDS-2017 intrusion detection dataset
* Build and evaluate high-performance machine learning models for attack detection
* Conduct a detailed forensic investigation into identified attacks
* Develop a reproducible pipeline for network traffic analysis

## 📊 Dataset Overview

* **Dataset:** Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity - Intrusion Detection System 2017 (CIC-IDS-2017)
* **Description:** The dataset contains network traffic captured over 5 days, including a wide variety of benign and malicious activities
* **Size:** The data is distributed across 8 CSV files, totaling 843.7 MB
* **Content:**
    * Initial Records: 2,830,743
    * Cleaned Records: 2,574,264 (90.9% data retention)
    * Attack Types: 14 unique attack categories were analyzed

### 🚨 Attack Types Analyzed
- BENIGN (Normal traffic)
- DoS Hulk
- DDoS attacks  
- Port Scan
- Web Attacks (Brute Force, XSS, SQL Injection)
- DoS variants (GoldenEye, slowloris, Slowhttptest)
- FTP-Patator & SSH-Patator
- Bot attacks
- Infiltration
- Heartbleed

## 🔬 Methodology

The project follows a structured data science workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, infinite values, and removed over 256,000 duplicate records
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created new insightful features such as `Flow_Bytes_Per_Packet` and `Packet_Size_Ratio` to improve model performance
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized the distribution of attack types, analyzed traffic patterns by day, and examined feature correlations
4. **Optimized Feature Selection:** Used a consensus-based approach combining F-Score and Random Forest Importance to identify the most predictive features
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trained and evaluated 5 different machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, on a sampled dataset for efficiency
6. **Model Interpretability (XAI):** Employed SHAP and Permutation Importance to understand the decisions of the best-performing model
7. **Forensic Investigation:** Conducted a deep-dive analysis into the most prevalent attack, **DoS Hulk**, to identify its unique network signature

## 🏆 Key Results

The analysis yielded high-performance models and actionable security insights.

### 📈 Model Performance

The **XGBoost** classifier was the top-performing algorithm with the following metrics on the test set:

* **Accuracy:** 99.87%
* **F1-Score:** 99.61%
* **Precision:** 99.66%
* **Recall:** 99.55%
* **ROC-AUC:** 99.99%

### 🔍 Key Findings

* **Feature Importance:** The model interpretability analysis identified `Destination Port`, `Init_Win_bytes_forward`, `Total Length of Fwd Packets`, and `Fwd Packet Length Max` as some of the most critical features for distinguishing attacks from benign traffic
* **Forensic Signature:** The "DoS Hulk" attack was characterized by an abnormally high `Max Packet Length` (10.53x higher than benign) and `Flow Duration` (5.34x higher), providing a clear signature for detection
* **Temporal Patterns:** Attack types were concentrated on specific days. For instance, the DoS Hulk attack occurred exclusively on Wednesday, while DDoS and PortScan attacks were captured on Friday
