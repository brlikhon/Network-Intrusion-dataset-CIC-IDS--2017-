## üìä Project Overview

The primary goals of this analysis are to:
* Analyze the CIC-IDS-2017 intrusion detection dataset
* Build and evaluate high-performance machine learning models for attack detection
* Conduct a detailed forensic investigation into identified attacks
* Develop a reproducible pipeline for network traffic analysis

This project provides:

- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of 12 different algorithms for intrusion detection
- **Forensic Investigation**: Professional cybersecurity analysis and reporting
- **Model Interpretability**: SHAP and LIME analysis for explainable AI

## üéØ Dataset Description

* **Dataset:** Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity - Intrusion Detection System 2017 (CIC-IDS-2017)
* **Description:** The dataset contains network traffic captured over 5 days, including a wide variety of benign and malicious activities
* **Size:** The data is distributed across 8 CSV files, totaling 843.7 MB
* **Content:**
    * Initial Records: 2,830,743
    * Cleaned Records: 2,574,264 (90.9% data retention)
    * Attack Types: 14 unique attack categories were analyzed

The dataset includes network traffic captured from Monday to Friday, containing:

- **Total Records**: 2,830,743 network flows
- **Features**: 79 network flow characteristics
- **Attack Types**: 15 different categories including:
  - BENIGN (Normal traffic)
  - DDoS attacks
  - Port Scan
  - Web Attacks (Brute Force, XSS, SQL Injection)
  - DoS variants (Hulk, GoldenEye, slowloris, Slowhttptest)
  - FTP-Patator & SSH-Patator
  - Bot attacks
  - Infiltration
  - Heartbleed

## üî¨ Methodology

The project follows a structured data science workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, infinite values, and removed over 256,000 duplicate records
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created new insightful features such as `Flow_Bytes_Per_Packet` and `Packet_Size_Ratio` to improve model performance
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized the distribution of attack types, analyzed traffic patterns by day, and examined feature correlations
4. **Optimized Feature Selection:** Used a consensus-based approach combining F-Score and Random Forest Importance to identify the most predictive features
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trained and evaluated 5 different machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, on a sampled dataset for efficiency
6. **Model Interpretability (XAI):** Employed SHAP and Permutation Importance to understand the decisions of the best-performing model
7. **Forensic Investigation:** Conducted a deep-dive analysis into the most prevalent attack, **DoS Hulk**, to identify its unique network signature

## üèÜ Key Results

The analysis yielded high-performance models and actionable security insights.

### üìà Model Performance

The **XGBoost** classifier was the top-performing algorithm with the following metrics on the test set:

* **Accuracy:** 99.87%
* **F1-Score:** 99.61%
* **Precision:** 99.66%
* **Recall:** 99.55%
* **ROC-AUC:** 99.99%

### üîç Key Findings

* **Feature Importance:** The model interpretability analysis identified `Destination Port`, `Init_Win_bytes_forward`, `Total Length of Fwd Packets`, and `Fwd Packet Length Max` as some of the most critical features for distinguishing attacks from benign traffic
* **Forensic Signature:** The "DoS Hulk" attack was characterized by an abnormally high `Max Packet Length` (10.53x higher than benign) and `Flow Duration` (5.34x higher), providing a clear signature for detection
* **Temporal Patterns:** Attack types were concentrated on specific days. For instance, the DoS Hulk attack occurred exclusively on Wednesday, while DDoS and PortScan attacks were captured on Friday
